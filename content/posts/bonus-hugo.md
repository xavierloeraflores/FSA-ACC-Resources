This website wasn't coded with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was actually coded using HUGO, which has the ability to generate static websites from markdown files. Websites built with HUGO are also known to be **blazingly fast**.  I wouldn't recommend learning HUGO just yet since it's important to build a strong foundation with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & React.  


## Bonus: Running this website locally: 
To run this project locally, follow the installation steps for installing [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).

Then clone this repository with the recursive flag set to install all dependencies:
```git clone --recursive git@github.com:xavierloeraflores/fsa-acc-resources.git```

Navigate to this projects folder and run ```hugo server``` to run the project locally.
